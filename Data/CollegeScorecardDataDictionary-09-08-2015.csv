Separate metrics are calculated for 4-year institutions and less-than-4-year institutions. The retention rate is calculated as the number of part-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates enrolled in the fall term of the current academic year divided by the number of part-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates enrolled in the fall of the prior academic year. This metric is not available prior to the 2004–05 academic year. Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent.
