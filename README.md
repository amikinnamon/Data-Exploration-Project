# Data-Exploration-Project

This project compiles together multiple data files, cleans and manipulates them, builds regression designs, and analyzes the findings to answer a research question: Among colleges that predominantly grant Bachelorâ€™s degrees, did the release of the College Scorecard in September 2015 shift student interest to high-earnings colleges relative to low-earnings ones?
